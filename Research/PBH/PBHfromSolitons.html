				<p>&emsp; Primordial black holes (PBH) are a theoretical type of black hole that would be created in the early universe from local overdensities
				which then would subsequently collapse during the cosmological epansion and form black holes. This is in stark contrast to the well-known stellar
				black holes, in which a large star runs out of fuel and either collapses on itself or explodes in a supernova, leaving a black hole behind as a
				remnant.</p>
				<p>&emsp; My research into Q-balls has led to the discovery that it is possible for PBH to form from non-uniformity in the distribution of
				nontopological solitons. In this scenario, a scalar condensate fragments into many (but not too many) solitons. Shortly after, the universe enters
				a soliton-dominated era, in which the local overdensities in the soliton distribution are allowed to grow. Once they become large enough, the
				overdensities collapse and form black holes. This scenario is explored in our papers
				"<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.031103">Primordial black holes from supersymmetry in the early universe</a>"
				[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02529">arXiv:1612.02529</a>] and in more detail in "Primordial black holes from scalar field evolution in the
				early universe" [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09003">arXiv:1706.09003</a>], and has apparently garnered much attention. Read the press release
				from the <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-physicists-propose-new-theories-of-black-holes-from-the-very-early-universe">UCLA
