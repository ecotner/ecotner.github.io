				<p>&emsp; This part of my research looks at the formation, evolution, and properties of a type of stable nontopological soliton called a Q-ball.
				Q-balls are lumps of a scalar or Bose-Einstein condensate, which gain their stability from a conserved U(1) charge. They can be produced
				in the early universe, and due to their stability, could survive to the present day. Their properties (depending on the model), make them
				an attractive candidate for dark matter, and they are a general prediction of many supersymmetric theories.</p>
				<p>&emsp; As part of my research, I have examined the constraints on baryonic Q-balls due to neutron star capture (see my paper
				<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.94.123006">Astrophysical constraints on dark-matter Q-balls in the presence
				of baryon-violating operators</a> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00970">arXiv:1609.00970</a>]). When a baryonic Q-ball falls into a
				neutron star, it begins converting neutrons on the surface into squarks which are absorbed into the Q-ball, eventually consuming it from
				the inside. We found that these constraints may	be relaxed if a small higher-order term is introduced to the Lagrangian which
				breaks the U(1) symmetry in some way. This allows the decay of the Q-ball quanta into light QCD degrees of freedom (pions) on the surface
				of the Q-balls, preventing them from growing and consuming the neutron star.</p>
