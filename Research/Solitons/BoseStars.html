				<p>&emsp; This part of my research is about modeling the gravitational collapse and evolution of cold scalar particles into a "Boson star", and the subsequent
				evolution and interactions of this type of object. Using these results, I hope to be able to be able to explain experimental
				data on the distribution of dark matter in galaxies and dark matter self-interaction cross section limits, or apply their interesting properties to
				cosmological scenarios.</p>
				<p>&emsp; When created through some non-thermal mechanism (like the Afflec-Dine process, or vacuum realignment in the case of axions), scalar particles form a
				Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), which can be treated as a macroscopic wavefunction.
				This then allows us to use the Schrodinger equation to solve for the time evolution and equilibrium states of the BEC. The gravitational and self
				interactions between field makes this equation highly nonlinear and nonlocal (often referred to as the NNSE or Nonlinear Nonlocal Schrodinger
				Equation), and requires either approximate solutions using the variational method, or numerical codes to solve properly. Their properties are very interesting:
				it appears that the more massive the condensate, the more tightly it is bound, and so heavy boson stars are actually incredibly dense. Some even believe that they
				would make good candidates for black hole mimickers, and could explain the supermassive black holes at the center of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Their
				radius is inversely related to the mass of the scalar field, and so stars made of very light bosons can be very large. Condenstates with particle mass of
				$10^{-23}$ eV can be hundreds of kiloparsecs across, and could explain why the Galactic nucleus has a dark matter core as opposed to the cusp predicted by CDM
				simulations.</p>
				<p>&emsp; I am currently investigating various types of numerical methods to model the
				time evolution of the BEC collapse into a Bose star, from which we can extract the timescale of collapse, spatial distribution, binding energy,
				mass, and other properties of this gravitationally bound state. Below are the results of a toy Mathematica simulation on a 25x25 grid in two dimensions of the collapse of
				a BEC to several Bose stars through the Jeans instability which then merge together before the simulation becomes numerically unstable.</p>

				<p>Here we see the interaction between two gravitationally bound Bose stars. The radial oscillation that is occurring in each soliton is due to the
				fact that the stars are not in their energy eigenstates. This simulation was performed on a 40x40 grid in two dimensions, utilizing a new algorithm
				in C to speed up computation.</p>

				<p>This is a simulation of a merger between two Bose stars (in 3D!). We can see that despite having no interactions besides gravity, the solitons will stick together, forming
				some weird lobed structure. This may be an excited, stable state; more research is ongoing to determine this.
